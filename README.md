           about.html #about page template
           contact.html #contact page template
```

Starting the app locally
========================

1. Create a file ```predim/user.cred``` with the relevant database access credentials like the following. This file will not be added to your version control (the `.gitignore` file will filter it out):
```
[database_creds]
host: <YOUR HOSTNAME>
port: <YOUR PORT>
user: <YOUR USERNAME>
database: <YOUR DATABASE>
password: <YOUR PASSOWRD>
```
2. Ensure your local machine can talk to the environment where the data resides in (ex: you may need to connect to a VPN if your data resides on a cluster behind a firewall)
3. Install Flask-Assets, which is a dependency for the App
```
easy_install Flask-Assets
```
4. Run the following from the root directory
```
./deploy
```
This will bring up the app on http://localhost:9090

Pushing the app to PCF
======================

1. Push the app to your PCF instance (assuming you've set one up)
```
dsmiot [master●●] cf push predimcf  -f manifest.yml    
```
2. Create User Provided Service for database credentials (first time only)
```
dsmiot [master●●] cf cups predimcreds -p '{"host":"<HOST>","user":"<USER>","password":"<PASSWORD>", "database":"<DATABASE>", "port":"<PORT>" }'
```
3. Bind the User Provided Service to the app (first time only)
```
dsmiot [master●●] cf bind-service predimcf predimcreds
```
The app should now be accessible on your PCF instance.
